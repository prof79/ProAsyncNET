## Pro Async .NET Samples ##

This repository contains examples based on the great book
["Pro Asynchronous Programming with .NET"](http://www.apress.com/9781430259206)
by Blewett/Clymer from [Apress](http://apress.com). The examples sometimes
closely follow the original, sometimes they don't - they are my own attempts
after all.

They are also a good reference for how certain things are done or
certain traps look like.
